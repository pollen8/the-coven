Become the leader of the Coven

## Background

When you were a baby your mum was a well respected member of the Coven, until she feel in love with 
origami and was cast out for her unnatural practices.

Her broom, wand, spellbook and hat were confiscated and cast to the four corners of the world.

Growing up, try as you might you just can't fold paper and find your life incomplete. Faced with your increasing
sadness you mother finally admits you might be more suited to witch craft and decides to send you to the 
Coven to be accepted as an apprentice.

After a short but adventurous journey, through lands that reek with poison and rot, you arrive at the Coven only to find it in deserted bar an old forgetful cat called Dave.
Accompanied by the cat you are drawn to a pulsating compass enscribed with the words "seek what was lost". Upon picking it
up the needle swings firmly towards the north and the dial rotates to align the needle with the symbol hat.

Following the compass you quickly arrive in a cavernous hall lined with hundreds of dusty hats in varying degrees of disrepair. Finally the compass points
to a hat with your mother's name under it. Upon placing it on your head you immeditately learn a couple of basic spells. 

In a flash of inspiration you realise that this compass will guide you towards the tools you might need to become a witch.
So you and Dave set out on your adventure.....
